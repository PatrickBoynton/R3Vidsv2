# R3Vidsv2

## To start:

1. Add a directory named public
2. Add some videos
3. Run docker compose
4. Use npm start
   Alternitavely you could start the app without adding videos and add them via an upload button.

## About

At the heart of it this is a random video or a tutorial viewer intended to be somewhat similar to YouTube or Udemy. It's not complete at all, the tutorial portion is being worked on at present. This is my sandbox app to play around with concepts and try things out.

## Known Issues:

The back and forward button only kind of works. Once you go forward or backward in the list it can't go back to the original video if you started in a random part of the list.
Another issue is currentIndex becomes null after the video has played.
